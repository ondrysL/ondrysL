### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am 18-year-old developer who is currently self-leatning code. Next year I plan to go to university and study computer science. Right now I have one year experience with backend programming, I was intern in one Prague company, where I learned Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

Here is a list of my current knowledge:
 - Java
 - PosgreSQL
